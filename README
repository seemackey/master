1) "CP" scripts for choice probability/detect probability analysis from
Mackey et al. (2022)

  Preprint  here:
  https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.15.496306

  Uses: CP_Analysis_ScriptCM,
        CP_Calc,
        CP_ROC

  Shell script is CP_Analysis_ScriptCM.m imports data and runs CP_Calc in a loop
  through all the data. CP_calc runs the CP function, which calculates CP using
  signal detection theoretic ROC analysis (CP_ROC function)


2) "MFdisc" and "samsmodlong" scripts for neuronal discrimination analysis
and population modeling

  Preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.05.502987


  Uses: samsmodlong_pooler_looper,
        samsmodlong_pooler_fxn,
        mfSort,
        MTF.m,
        mfROC or mfROC_pop,
        and trimmer.m if the duration is less than 500 ms.

  Shell script is samsmodlong_pooler_looper.m, which imports data and runs
  samsmodlong_pooler_fxn - this function uses mfSort.m and MTF.m to pick out
  neurons and certain trials. At that point the responses are extracted and it
  does ROC analysis (mfROC for a single neuron or mfROCpop for populations)
  This is describing the population level analysis, but samsmodlong_noActX.m
  does all of this for a single neuron.
